## Problem Definition

Fitness and health are key components of a balanced lifestyle, yet finding accessible and reliable resources for fitness and nutrition can be challenging. Many existing platforms lack a comprehensive approach, focusing only on either exercise or diet without integrating both into a single user-friendly solution.

This project bridges that gap by providing a one-stop fitness hub that:
- Educates users on aerobic, flexibility, stability, and resistance exercises.
- Offers nutritional insights to complement physical fitness.
- Enables users to adopt a holistic approach to their health.
